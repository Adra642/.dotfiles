# ADRA.Dots

This is my personal configuration for terminal, includes configuration files for Wezterm and Alacritty terminals, a Oh-My-Zsh theme, and config file and layout for Zellij multiplexer. Also contains a python script for color schemes selection and a toml file with some of my favorite schemes.
